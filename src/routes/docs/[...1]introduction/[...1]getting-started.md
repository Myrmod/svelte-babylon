Svelte-Babylon is a [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) component library for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It is highly inspired by [svelte-cubed](https://svelte-cubed.vercel.app/), a component library for building [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) scene graphs in Svelte apps.

**This library is a work in progress**. It has not been tested in its entirety and there are surely bugs, that haven't been fixed or even been identified.

If you find anything not working as expected, it would be great for you to open an [issue](https://github.com/Myrmod/svelte-babylon/issues).

## Creating a project

```:no-line-numbers
npm init svelte@next my-new-app
cd my-new-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then install BabylonJS and Svelte-Babylon:

```bash:no-line-numbers
npm install @babylonjs/core svelte-babylon
```

Now you're set up to build your own 3D scenes.

## Your first scene

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import ArcRotateCamera from 'svelte-babylon/components/Cameras/ArcRotateCamera/index.svelte'
  import Canvas from 'svelte-babylon/components/Canvas/index.svelte'
  import Scene from 'svelte-babylon/components/Scene/index.svelte'
  import Box from 'svelte-babylon/components/Objects/Box/index.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Scene>
    <HemisphericLight />
    <ArcRotateCamera />
    <Box />
  </Scene>
</Canvas>
```

As Svelte-Babylon is a libray that implements BabylonJS in a component driven manner, we can create a very simple scene using only our Svelte knowledge with barely any regard to BabylonJS itself.

Our `Canvas` component is the wrapper of the BabylonJS [Engine](https://doc.babylonjs.com/typedoc/classes/babylon.engine) and an `HTMLCanvasElement`. The `Scene` component implements a BabylonJS [Scene](https://doc.babylonjs.com/typedoc/classes/babylon.scene).
Furthermore all components, that are allowed to have children create a [svelte context](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api) which holds the corresponding BabylonJS implementation.
This context is bindable, eg. via `<Canvas bind:engine>`. This allows you to use BabylonJS with all of its features, even if implementations are missing. You have to refer to the [BabylonJS documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com/) though.

Let's add `Ground` and adjust the positions of the box. We also add some settings to the `Canvas` to make the scene look a little sharper.

```diff
<script lang="ts">
  import ArcRotateCamera from 'svelte-babylon/components/Cameras/ArcRotateCamera/index.svelte'
  import Canvas from 'svelte-babylon/components/Canvas/index.svelte'
  import Scene from 'svelte-babylon/components/Scene/index.svelte'
  import Box from 'svelte-babylon/components/Objects/Box/index.svelte'
+  import Ground from 'svelte-babylon/components/Objects/Ground/index.svelte'
+  import HemisphericLight from 'svelte-babylon/components/Lights/HemisphericLight/index.svelte'
+  import type { AbstractMesh } from '@babylonjs/core/Meshes/abstractMesh'
+  import type { Mesh } from '@babylonjs/core/Meshes/mesh.js'
+  import type { Writable } from 'svelte/types/runtime/store'

+  let object: <Writable<Mesh>
</script>

- <Canvas>
+ <Canvas
+  antialiasing
+  engineOptions={{
+    preserveDrawingBuffer: true,
+    stencil: true,
+  }}
+ >
  <Scene>
    <HemisphericLight />
    <ArcRotateCamera />
-   <Box />
+   <Box y={3} bind:object />
+   <Ground
+     options={{ width: 6, height: 6 }}
+     y={1}
+   />
  </Scene>
</Canvas>
```

For the `Ground` we set it's width and height. For the `Ground` as well as the `Box` we set their `y-position` to have a better look at them.
Furthermore we bind the `Box` components object property to a variable.

Using BabylonJS itself we can create a 3D-Vector (a point in the 3D space) which we can pass as a whole to the `target` property of the `ArcRotateCamera` for it to focus on the position where the `Box` is initially placed. Since we bound to the `Box` components object we could've also used `$object.position` to archive a similar result. However we would need to make sure, that the `Box` component has mounted before the `ArcRotateCamera`.

Now we can add some shadow

```diff
<script lang="ts">
  import ArcRotateCamera from 'svelte-babylon/components/Cameras/ArcRotateCamera/index.svelte'
  import Box from 'svelte-babylon/components/Objects/Box/index.svelte'
  import Canvas from 'svelte-babylon/components/Canvas/index.svelte'
  import Scene from 'svelte-babylon/components/Scene/index.svelte'
+  import DirectionalLight from 'svelte-babylon/components/Lights/DirectionalLight/index.svelte'
  import Ground from 'svelte-babylon/components/Objects/Ground/index.svelte'
  import HemisphericLight from 'svelte-babylon/components/Lights/HemisphericLight/index.svelte'
  import type { AbstractMesh } from '@babylonjs/core/Meshes/abstractMesh'
  import type { Mesh } from '@babylonjs/core/Meshes/mesh.js'
  import type { Writable } from 'svelte/types/runtime/store'

  let object: <Writable<Mesh>

+  let shadowObjects: Array<Mesh>
+  $: {
+    const temp: typeof shadowObjects = []
+    if ($object) {
+      temp.push($object)
+    }
+    shadowObjects = temp
+  }
</script>

 <Canvas
  antialiasing
  engineOptions={{
    preserveDrawingBuffer: true,
    stencil: true,
  }}
 >
  <Scene>
-  <HemisphericLight />
+  <HemisphericLight intensity={0.5} />
+  <DirectionalLight
+    intensity={0.25}
+    direction={new Vector3(-10, -20, -10)}
+    position={new Vector3(2, 6, 2)}
+    castShadowOf={shadowObjects}
+  />
  <ArcRotateCamera />
  <Box y={3} bind:object />
  <Ground
    options={{ width: 6, height: 6 }}
    y={1}
+   receiveShadows
  />
  </Scene>
</Canvas>
```

Shadows are somewhat tricky to handle. A light needs to know what objects it should cast a shadow from. So we need to provide it an array of references to the objects, which should have a shadow.

Objects like our `Ground` components' have to know, that there might be a shadow to be cast on them. So we have to add the `receiveShadows` attribute to them.

And that's it. Your first scene using Svelte Babylon. Here is the whole code:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import ArcRotateCamera from 'svelte-babylon/components/Cameras/ArcRotateCamera/index.svelte'
  import Canvas from 'svelte-babylon/components/Canvas/index.svelte'
  import DirectionalLight from 'svelte-babylon/components/Lights/DirectionalLight/index.svelte'
  import HemisphericLight from 'svelte-babylon/components/Lights/HemisphericLight/index.svelte'
  import Box from 'svelte-babylon/components/Objects/Box/index.svelte'
  import Ground from 'svelte-babylon/components/Objects/Ground/index.svelte'
  import Scene from 'svelte-babylon/components/Scene/index.svelte'
  import { Vector3 } from '@babylonjs/core/Maths/math.vector'
  import type { Mesh } from '@babylonjs/core/Meshes/mesh.js'
  import type { Writable } from 'svelte/types/runtime/store'

  let object: Writable<Mesh>

  let shadowObjects: Array<Mesh>
  $: {
    const temp: typeof shadowObjects = []
    if ($object) {
      temp.push($object)
    }
    shadowObjects = temp
  }
</script>

<Canvas
  antialiasing={true}
  engineOptions={{
    preserveDrawingBuffer: true,
    stencil: true,
  }}
>
  <Scene>
    <HemisphericLight intensity={0.5} />
    <DirectionalLight
      intensity={0.25}
      direction={new Vector3(-10, -20, -10)}
      position={new Vector3(2, 6, 2)}
      castShadowOf={shadowObjects}
    />
    <ArcRotateCamera target={new Vector3(0, 3, 0)} />
    <Box y={3} bind:object />
    <Ground options={{ width: 6, height: 6, subdivisions: 2 }} receiveShadows y={1} />
  </Scene>
</Canvas>
```

If there're any svelte specific question you can ask via [discord](https://discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/), questions for BabylonJS can go to the [forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com/).
In both cases you can use `@myrmod` to give a shoutout for me, since there is only one developer for now :).
