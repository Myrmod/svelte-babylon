[BabylonJS reference](https://doc.babylonjs.com/toolsAndResources/tools/inspector)

:::admonition type="warning"
The user interface of the inpspector is written in react. It would be quite a heavy load to rewrite it in either svelte or without any framework.
You can always create custom debug layers using the tools you know. You can for example use the `$scene` object of you `Scene` component as a starting point. There is nothing custom built into svelte-babylon. As long as you don't use the `Inspector` in production there wont be any negative impact.

## Example

<ExampleWrapper id='InspectorStory'>
  <InspectorStory />
</ExampleWrapper>

### Code

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import ArcRotateCamera from 'svelte-babylon/components/Cameras/ArcRotateCamera/index.svelte'
  import Canvas from 'svelte-babylon/components/Canvas/index.svelte'
  import DirectionalLight from 'svelte-babylon/components/Lights/DirectionalLight/index.svelte'
  import HemisphericLight from 'svelte-babylon/components/Lights/HemisphericLight/index.svelte'
  import Inspector from 'svelte-babylon/components/Misc/Inspector/index.svelte'

  import Scene from 'svelte-babylon/components/Scene/index.svelte'
  import '@babylonjs/core/Debug/debugLayer'
  import { Vector3 } from '@babylonjs/core/Maths/math.vector'
</script>

<Canvas antialiasing>
  <Scene>
    <HemisphericLight intensity={0.5} />
    <DirectionalLight intensity={0.5} direction={new Vector3(-10, -20, -10)} />
    <ArcRotateCamera />
